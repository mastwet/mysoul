# Validation ledger

All results are local development evidence, not live deployment claims.

## T01
- RED: storage test collection failed because mysoul.domain was absent.
- GREEN: 8 tests passed with SQLite restart and conflict assertions.
- Environment: uv-managed CPython 3.12.12; exact dependencies in uv.lock.
- Baseline: planning-only repository, no pre-existing application tests.
- Workflow adaptation: PowerShell maintains the same task ledger as the Bash skill helpers; task headings in the existing plan remain authoritative.

## T02
- RED: life module absent. GREEN: 7 tests passed, including 1,000 quiet rest ticks and a bounded 1,000-event burst.
- Fatigue calibration is configurable; paired deterministic traces will be recorded in T10.

## T03
- RED: effects/executor modules absent. GREEN: 7 executor/checkpoint tests passed.
- Tested actual AsyncSqliteSaver persistence (langgraph 1.2.16, checkpoint-sqlite 3.1.2).
- Unknown effects are retained; cancellation and owner interruption do not erase remote receipts.
